# Karma

Karma is a programming language built for robotics.

## Why build Karma?

Developing code for a physical system is fundamentally different from a normal piece of software. These code bases often combine a variety of paradigms and solutions into one program, and engineers deal with parallelism, messaging and communication, linear algebra, and other topics regularly. Current frameworks that try to help facilitate robotics software can be bloated and poorly documented, leading to frustration and hours wasted.

Karma wants to solve this by baking the most common paradigms, algorithms, and structures in robotics software into the language itself. Safe communication between two subsystems will be as easy as declaring a variable and using it. A representation of your robot as a graph can be mapped one-to-one to Karma code. Other quality of life features will make it easy to get started with common robot subsystems, such as drivetrains, 3-axis arms, sensor suites, etc.

## To-Do

Karma is still very much a **work-in-progress** and many features do not exist yet. This is a list of features that will be added (in no particular order):

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Chars
- [ ] Booleans
- [ ] String literals
- [ ] Custom data structures
- [ ] Rust-like Options
- [ ] For loops
- [ ] Communication between nodes
- [ ] Trinary logic
